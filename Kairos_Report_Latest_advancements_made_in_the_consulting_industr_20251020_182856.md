**Kairos Insight Report: Unlocking Blue Ocean Opportunities in the Evolving Consulting Landscape**

**Executive Summary:**
The consulting industry, a robust $362.5 billion market, is in the midst of a profound transformation driven by digital innovation, AI, and an increasing demand for specialized, outcome-oriented solutions.
